                Bhagat Singh, better known as, Shaheed Bhagat Singh was a freedom fighter who left no stone unturned to bring about
                reforms in the fight against the British. He is said to be one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian
                freedom struggle.</p>
                <p>
                He was born in a Sikh family in Punjab on the 28th of September 1907. Many of his family members including his father
                and uncles were actively involved in the struggle for Indian independence. His family as well as certain events that
                occurred during that time were an inspiration for him to dive into the freedom struggle at an early age. As a teenager,
                he studied about the European revolutionary movements and was drawn towards the Anarchist and Marxist ideologies. He
                soon joined the revolutionary activities and played an active part in them inspiring many others to join the same.

                <p>
                
                The turning point in his life was the killing of freedom fighter, Lala Lajpat Rai. Bhagat Singh could not tolerate the
                injustice and planned to revenge Raiâ€™s death. He planned the murder of British Official John Saunders and to bomb the
                Central Legislative Assembly.</p>
                <p>
                He surrendered himself after carrying out these incidents and was eventually hanged by the British government. He became
                an inspiration for the Indian youth owing to these heroic acts.
